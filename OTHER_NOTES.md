README should always tell you: 
  - What the app is.
  - How to run the app.
  - How to run the tests.

Specs
  - No pending.
  - Should be fast.
  - Should almost never hit external services.

Vim
  TComment plugin - C---
  di'
  da'
  dap
  set grepprg=ack (or ag, faster), then: :grep foo to search whole project
  set relativenumber
  Tests
    Run from vim http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/57444559280/running-specs-from-vim
  Snippets are good. Find a plugin for it and define your own (plus steal mine)
